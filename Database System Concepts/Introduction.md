- A DBMS is a collection of data and programs to access that data.
- The database contains information relevant to an enterprise.
- The primary goal of a DBMS is to store and retrieve database information conveniently and efficiently.
- Database systems are designed to manage large bodies of information.
- Management of data involves defining structures for storage and providing mechanisms for manipulation.
- The system must ensure the safety of the information stored and avoid anomalous results if data are shared among several users.

# 1.1 Database-System Applications
-   Database systems manage collections of valuable, large, and multi-user accessed data.
-   The earliest database applications were simple compared to modern applications.
-   Modern applications include highly sophisticated, worldwide enterprises.
-   All database applications share important common elements and have data as their central aspect.
-   Database applications today include data with complex relationships and a more variable structure.
-   Modern database systems exploit commonalities in the structure of data to gain efficiency, but also allow for weakly structured data and for data whose formats are highly variable.
-   A database system is a large, complex software system whose task is to manage a large, complex collection of data.
-   Abstraction allows a person to use a complex device or system without having to know the details of how that device or system is constructed.
-   Representative applications of database systems are in **enterprise information, manufacturing, banking and finance, universities, airlines, telecommunication, web-based services, document databases, and navigation systems**.
-   Databases form an essential part of every enterprise and a large part of a personâ€™s daily activities.
